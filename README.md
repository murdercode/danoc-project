# DANOC (Device for Ambient and Nutrient Observation in Caves) Board Project

The DANOC Board Project is an innovative DIY solution designed for speleologists and cave enthusiasts who wish to monitor various environmental parameters within caves. This Arduino-based project leverages the capabilities of the Nicla Sense ME and an Adafruit_SSD1306 display to provide real-time data on temperature, humidity, gas levels, and other vital environmental metrics. Whether you're conducting scientific research or simply exploring the underground world, DANOC offers a compact, efficient, and customizable tool to enhance your cave exploration experience.

## Features

- **Real-time Environmental Monitoring**: Track temperature, humidity, gas concentrations, and more within cave environments.
- **Arduino-based**: Utilizes the versatile and widely-supported Arduino platform for ease of programming and customization.
- **Nicla Sense ME Integration**: Leverages this powerful sensor board for accurate environmental readings.
- **Adafruit_SSD1306 Display**: Displays real-time data readings on a crisp OLED screen, making it easy to monitor conditions at a glance.
- **DIY and Customizable**: Designed with the DIY community in mind, allowing for modifications and customizations to fit specific needs.
